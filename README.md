<h2>🩺 Deep4ORL — Deep Learning for Otoscopy in Low-Resource Settings</h2>
<hr>

Deep4ORL is a deep learning project designed to improve the automated diagnosis of ear pathologies from otoscopy images, with a focus on clinical environments in low-resource settings. The project enhances an existing AlexNet-based model, expands the training dataset, and deploys the improved model in real-world healthcare facilities for validation.
